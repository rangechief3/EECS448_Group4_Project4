Time estimation:

To estimate the person hours it would take to complete this project, we used the lines of code method.
To do this, we first looked at previous projects to estimate how long it takes us to write each line of code. We completed
the first three projects with 2161 lines of code in 121.25 hours. This comes out to .056 hours per line of code. From here, we
estimated that it would take us an additional 300 lines of code to complete our project. This comes out to 16.8 hours to
complete the project.
